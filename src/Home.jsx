                Metadium uses its advanced technology and experience to provide
                a new ecosystem of compliant services and solutions that serve
                as the bridge to blockchainâ€™s true potential. Metadium
                Governance can receive various proposals to improve Metadium in
                a decentralized way, and network members can directly
                participate in decision-making. Enable active governance
                operations through an autonomous authority configuration to
                develop and grow the Metadium ecosystem.

                  Metadium staking is one of the prerequisites to becoming an
                  authority member. The staking method is possible by sending
                  Metadium while calling a predefined function in the governance
                  contract known at the system level. Even if staking is
                  completed, it cannot become a member unless an official
                  contract with the Metadium Blockchain Foundation and identity
                  disclosure is made.
